## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
### **Fundamental Concepts of Version Control & Why GitHub is Popular**  

#### **üîπ What is Version Control?**  
Version control is a **system that tracks changes to files** over time, allowing developers to:  
‚úÖ **Collaborate efficiently** without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.  
‚úÖ **Revert to previous versions** if mistakes are made.  
‚úÖ **Track changes** and understand who made what modifications.  

There are two types of version control systems:  
1. **Centralized Version Control (CVCS)** ‚Äì Uses a single server to store all files (e.g., SVN).  
2. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)** ‚Äì Each user has a full copy of the repository (e.g., **Git**, Mercurial).  

---

#### **üîπ Why is GitHub a Popular Version Control Tool?**  
GitHub is an online platform that **enhances Git‚Äôs functionality** by providing:  
‚úÖ **Cloud storage** for repositories, so developers can access their code from anywhere.  
‚úÖ **Collaboration tools** (pull requests, issue tracking, discussions).  
‚úÖ **Branching & Merging** to allow multiple features or fixes to be developed simultaneously.  
‚úÖ **Security & Backup** features to protect projects.  
‚úÖ **Integration with CI/CD tools** for automated testing and deployment.
